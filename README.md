## RayTracing 322COM

<br>
</br>

In this project, the focus was to use initialized primatives and background,
of which are ray-traced to the screen by checking each pixel in the
intersection if it intersects apply a colour to it and check if it is
infront of each object or behind it.

While there is no intersection with no objects, do not display coloured
pixel and instead run a function that would display a background picture.
