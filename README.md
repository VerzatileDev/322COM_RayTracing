RayTracing 322COM

In this project, our primary objective was to utilize initialized primitives and a background. We accomplished this by employing ray tracing techniques to determine how each pixel on the screen interacts with the scene.

For every pixel, we conducted intersection tests to determine if it intersects with any objects in the scene. If an intersection occurred, we applied a specific color to that pixel, taking into consideration whether the intersection point was in front of or behind the objects.

When no intersections were found with any objects, we implemented a function that displays a background picture instead of colored pixels. This allowed us to seamlessly integrate the background into the scene when no objects obstructed the view.
